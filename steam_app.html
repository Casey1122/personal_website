                    <h1>Steam App Design</h1>
                    <p>I have to admit that I am a true gamer, from Playstation, Switch to PC. I didn’t break my bank to purchase every discounted game on Steam, but I am a senior Steamer. Oftentime, I feel like the native Steam App isn’t easy enough to use. Number of disadvantages to include, like information overload, uniform visual level and busy layout. Steam was created in 2003 and reinvented in 2019, but still it lacks today's simplicity, perhaps it’s due to  its sales-conscious approach. However, Steam has grown into a “BIG” platform to provide robust features like community, news and updates and also streaming service. The current appearance is just too much, leaving no room to breathe. A new UI is overdue.</p>

                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>There are several UI problems raised by the Steam Community, namely complicated user interface, redundant elements, blurry visual hierarchical arrangement and information overload. Even a Big Picture mode is provided for screen resolution higher than 1080p, but that is working well in terms of design and pixel sharpness.</p>
                
                    <h2>Goals</h2>
                    <p>This project aims to revamp the app with essential information, easy navigation and adding a modernity.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Idea Transformation</h2>
                    <p>I have thought of prioritizing page elements, hidding or putting away less important elements. No more intrusive promotional window.</p>
                    <img class="img-style" src="./img/Idea Transformation-01.jpg" alt="Idea Transformation Process">
    
                    <h2>Insight 1: Trim down unnecessary information</h2>
                    <p>Oftentimes, there is so much information overloading the app, crowded yet all in the same visual level. Reducing a certain amount of info could help make the page less busy.
                    </p><span class="blue-text"></span>
                    <p class="blue-text">Result: Removing and hidding excessive tags like other available languages, game genres and game platform reviews, and leave the essential parts including gallery, game introduction, system requirement and packages. No more intrusive overlay to disturb gamers. Advertising carousel is now in Home after login in.</p>
                
                    <h2>Insight 2: Leverage better visual hierarchy</h2>
                    <p>Steam app positions almost every element at a similar visual level, making it hard for gamers to find what they are looking for. </p>
                    <p class="blue-text">Result: Game promotion always includes very bold and characterized images, Steam app should keep itself simple and yet reveal gamer identity. Dark theme paired with a corporate color and a few basic colors will do, helping the game imagery to pop.
                    </p>
    
                    <h2>Insight 3: Modern Touch with real gaming identity</h2>
                    <p>Steam was created in 2003 and the latest UI update was in 2019. However, the appearance seems busy and lacks a gaming identity. </p>
                    <p class="blue-text last-text">Result: A modern touch is injected into the Steam App to reinvent the whole appearance. To accomplish this task, fonts and color palette are replaced, together with relayout and white space. Ideally to accommodate sales and boost user numbers.
                    </p>
    
                    <img class="img-style" src="./img/Steam_Home.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Instead of intrusive pop-up, big hero carousel are positioned in prominent visual hierarchy. Carousel previews are included for user to check all promotion at a glance.</p>
                
                    <video src="./img/Steam_app_hero_carousel_lo.mp4" width="100%" autoplay loop></video>
                    <p>Home page now is presented with limited scroll. Key promotions are now shown in carousel and Monthly Highlight. Selected News, New Releases and Upcoming Releases are placed just below promotion area. Smaller covers and less tags and introduction help keep the page clean easy to explore. Social Media like unlimited scrolling is now replaced by a banner at the bottom to encourge gamers to browse the game store page.</p>
               
                    <img class="img-style" src="./img/Steam_Store - Fall Guys.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Existing Steam Game page is overloaded with information and unforunately they are all position at the same visual level.
                        For the ease of transaction, only necessary information and brief introduction are presented above the fold. Articles and video reviews can be access easily these days and ofterntimes is done better than on game store. These elements should be included but hide underneath. User can still see them if they want to.</p>
                
                    <video src="./img/Steam_purchase_lo.mp4" width="100%" autoplay loop></video>
    
                    <img class="img-style" src="./img/Steam_Live.jpg" alt="Steam Live Page">
                    <img class="img-style" src="./img/Steam_Community.jpg" alt="Steam Community Page">
                    <p>Steam has grown into a very robust app that also include Live and Community. These extra funcations did a good job to keep gamers together. For better user experience, these thumbnails should be kept apart from the Home page in order to boost app performance and create a simple ui.</p>
                    
                    <img class="img-style" src="./img/Steam_UserDashboard.jpg" alt="Steam User Dashboard Page">
                    <p>Personal Profile is now revamped and becomes more image-consicous. It provides more account details, making share and new connection easily.</p>
    
                    <h2>Final Thought</h2>
                    <p id="last-p">Steam is now one of the leading game distribution platforms, providing so much that one can enjoy. I also am a passionate gamer who loves shopping and playing on Steam. But at this point, I think Steam really should consider revamping and improving UX and UI. Hopefully it will get invented soon and be more user-centric / user friendly. </p>
